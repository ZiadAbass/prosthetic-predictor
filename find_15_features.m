%{
This function takes in the labelled data and uses the minimum redundancy 
maximum relevance algorithm to find the most significant 15 features among 
the existing 294 features. It extracts these 15 features and plots a 
labelled bar graph of their scores.
Parameters:

Arguments:
- `labelledData`        -> labelled data
- `unlabelledInputs`    -> input data with no labels
- `classLabels`         -> svm-specific target data

Returns:
- `fifteenFeaturesLabelledData`  -> a condensed version of the given
`labelledData` that has samples from only the top 15 features.
