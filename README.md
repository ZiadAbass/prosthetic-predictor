# prosthetic-predictor
This is a MATLAB-based machine learning project used to classify 5 different activities of daily living from IMU data. Both a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Pattern Recognition Network (ANN) are built, optimised and tested.

## The Data
The data used was collected from various healthy volunteers who wore 5 IMU sensors on different parts of the body:
- Right foot
- Left foot
- Right thigh
- Left thigh
- Pelvis

They performed 5 activities of daily living while wearing these IMUs:
- Level-Ground walking
- Going up a ramp
- Going down a ramp
- Standing to sitting
- Sitting to standing

## Data Preprocessing

## The Machine Learning Models
### Artificial Neural Network
A pattern recognition network is created with a single hidden layer 

### Support Vector Machine

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Change your MATLAB directory to that of the repo
3. Run `main.m` and you're good to go!
>NOTE: There are some optional function calls commented out in `main.m`. Look through the file to determine the code flow.
